lovecamedown2013
================

Processing.js project for the 2013 "Love Came Down" event

Notes:
*  First I draw a grid of triangles
*  Then I take in the webcam input
*  Then based off the webcam input's color, I color the appropriate triangles in the grid
*  Then I apply a slight green tint

Todo:
*  I would like to make have a title of "Love Came Down" that is spelled out with brighter triangles
*  Then I would like people's movements to temporarily wipe out that title, which comes back when there's minimal cam motion.
